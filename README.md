## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: The core framework for building the mobile app.

Install yarn by following the instructions at [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).
- **Expo CLI**: To develop React Native applications, you'll need Expo CLI. Install it globally using npm or yarn:
